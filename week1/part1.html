            <h2>What is Scrum?</h2>
            <li><p class="points">- Scrum is a framework/structure of Agile that consists of four stages/ceremonies called sprints. These process ensure steady, effective work flow and product delivery.</p></li>
         </ul>
         <ul class="week">
            <h2>What are the four ceremonies of Scrum?</h2>
            <li><p class="points">- Sprint Planning: Is like the team talk a soccer team undergoes before kicking off their game. In this process the team highlights and strategizes what is to be done within the next sprint.</p></li>
            <li><p class="points">- Sprint Demo: Is the process whereby the team breaks down how far they are with they designated task.</p></li>
            <li><p class="points">- Daily Standup: Is a fifteen minute team talk the team undergoes on a daily basis to highlight the progress of the team and to establish any difficulties the team might be experiencing that might be serving as blockers. This also synchronizes the team with regards to how far the team is to completing the current sprint and encourages collaboration between the team with regards to possible solutions for any blockers.</p></li>
            <li><p class="points">- Retrospective: Is the more like the wrap up after a soccer match whereby the team discusses their performance for the current sprint and is also used to highlight what had gone well and also what had gone wrong for the current sprint.</p></li>
         </ul>
         <ul class="week">
            <h2>Why is scrum better than other software development methodologies?</h2>
            <li><p class="points">- The methodology encourages unity amongst teammates, creates self-organization and allows the team to learn and grow through trail and error. The methodology also allows teammates to be incredibly versatile within their given tasks and through this is effective work flow able to take place and for company objectives to be met.</p></li>
         </ul>
         <ul class="week">
            <h2>What is Howlers five steps in software development?</h2>
            <li><p class="points">When code is added to the master the team is required to undergo the following steps to insure high quality code is merged and also to insure that a particular objective is met. (Example new WhatsApp feature)</p></li>
            <li><p class="points">- Code is written by one of our developers at Howler on Github.com and then is tested on Circleci.com</p></li>
            <li><p class="points">- The written code is then reviewed by fellow developers on the team to establish if the written code of high quality and if the code is ready to undergo a quality check. Once the code has been ‘Approved’ by fellow developers is the code then able to undergo a quality check. (Slack.com to Github.com)</p></li>
            <li><p class="points">- Once approved the newly written code (Feature or Bug rectification) is then sent to a quality assurer who then puts the code to the test to establish if the code is of good quality and is ready to be sent for further testing. If the quality assurer finds the newly written code to be of poor quality the developer is then required to re-write the code in question, make it better and then undergo the review process again and once approved have the code re-sent to QA</p></li>
            <li><p class="points">- UAT Is the final testing phase that a newly written code undergoes usually by a actual customer audience or the product owner to insure that the feature is working effectively and has reached its overall objective.</p></li>
            <li><p class="points">- Once the newly developed feature or bug rectification is done then is it deployed or merged into the master which will enable the newly developed feature to be put into use. Heroku.com</p></li>
